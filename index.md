## About Me

I am currently a Post-Doc at the [SEPIA](https://www.irit.fr/departement/architecture-systemes-reseaux/equipe-sepia/) research team in the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse ([IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/)).
I'm working with [Georges DA COSTA](https://www.irit.fr/~Georges.Da-Costa/) and [Patricia STOLF](https://www.irit.fr/~Patricia.Stolf/) on scheduling of tasks with dependencies in the context of smart-cities edge computing infrastructures powered by renewable energy.

I did my Ph.D. as a double degree between the Université Grenoble Alpes (France) in the [DATAMOVE](https://team.inria.fr/datamove/) research team, and the University of São Paulo (Brazil) in the [Graduate Program in Information Systems](http://ppgsi.each.usp.br/?lang=en).

My advisors were [Fanny Dufossé](https://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~fdufosse/) and [Daniel Cordeiro](http://www.each.usp.br/dc/).

In my thesis, I explored approaches to reduce the environmental impact of cloud computing platforms, focusing on the scheduling of the workloads that the
clouds receive and the computing of the optimal renewable infrastructures (such as solar panels and batteries) for the data centers that host these platforms, since it is not trivial ﬁnding their ideal dimensions, given that they also present a signiﬁcant carbon footprint. You can watch my defense [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/s19UBCIjGsg?feature=shared) and the final version of the manuscript is [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04678116).
